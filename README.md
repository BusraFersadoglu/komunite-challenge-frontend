# Kom√ºnite Front-End Challenge

Hey! With this challenge, we want you to demonstrate your proficiency in applying Atomic Design methodology, an important technical skill. This task requires you to create a Todo application using NextJS framework, Tailwind CSS, Atomic Design methodology, and Typescript in React.

## Task Description

For this task, you are required to create a simple todo application that allows the user to list, add, delete, and edit their tasks (todos), using only the /components folder and applying Atomic Design methodology. Please use the following folders for Atomic Design:

- src
  - components
    - atoms
    - molecules
    - organisms
    - templates
  - pages
    - index.tsx (page where the home template will be used)

Please do not access any folder outside of these. Additionally, you are required to use React hooks and Typescript, and you must not stray from the Atomic Design methodology.

## Getting Started

To get started, please fork this repository and create a new branch with your name. Please complete the task within **2 days** and share the link to your forked repository with us.
